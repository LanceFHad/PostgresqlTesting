In order to access the postgresql shell
1. Login as root using the $ su command
2. Execute the command $ service postgresql start 
(if it isn't already started, which can be checked with the command service postgresql status)
3. Execute the command $ sudo -u postgres psql
4. This puts you into the postgresql shell

There are several commands to know in the shell
=# \q quit
=# \c [database name] access a specific database
=# \dt (while accessing a database) to show tables
=# \l show all databases
You can also execute sql commands so long as they are formatted correctly and have a semicolon at the end
I have created a database test, I don't know if it exists on other logins on the computer, but since
postgresql is installed globally I believe it will be.

This code has access to the PostGreSql driver in it's lib folder, as well as the mongo drivers
Good luck!
